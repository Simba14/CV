In my shiny finance job I would count down the hours of the day. That has all changed since becoming a developer.

I'm now frustrated by the need to sleep. I'm obsessed with improving my skills and expanding my knowledge. And I'm itching to find a job that will help facilitate that.


I AM A... Junior Full Stack Developer hot off the Makers Academy press, one of Europe's leading development bootcamps.

I CODE BECAUSE... It makes me happy! Its creative, complex, and redefining every industry it touches. It's one massive chain of problems that I feel compelled to solve.

I SPEAK... Ruby, JavaScript, TDD, Pair-Programming, XP Values and HTML/CSS.

I'M SEEKING... to join an ambitious, dynamic team that promotes an environment of continual learning and progression. Momentum is key for me. I want to be trusted with delivering high quality code from the get go but have faith in the provision of resources and guidance to help me achieve that.

**Camarco** (June 2016 to February 2017)    
*Consultant*  
My last role was as a consultant with Camarco, a financial communications agency, where my main duty was to generate first-hand research and analysis that formed the basis of strategic advice to our clients. Working across nine clients simultaneously meant my communication skills, both verbal and written, progressed significantly and I was given full autonomy to write public statements and internal documents on client’s behalf.

**CognitionX** (August 2015 to June 2016)   
*Entrepreneurial Graduate*  
My first job out of university was with CognitionX, a data science startup, for whom I created, from scratch, a configurable financial model, which enabled detailed forecasting and scenario analysis. I also played a key role in a successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised over £20,000.

- Yoga - On a mission to touch my toes.
- Football - Watching, playing, obsessing. Wenger Out.
- Music - Reformed choir boy, horrible guitar player, unruly dancer.
